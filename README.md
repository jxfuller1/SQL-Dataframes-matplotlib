# SQL-Dataframes-matplotlib
This is by far my most extensive program made to date, utilizing the latest techniques i've learned and utilizing the GUI Template that is on this
repository that I made.

This is a program I made that uses Sqlite3 to read/write to a SQL database.   It many cases it uses pandas to retrieve the information as a dataframe
using the connectorx extension of pandas, which is faster than just straight using pandas.  This is my latest program that uses vectorization on the 
dataframes for faster performance.  

I then use that data to create charts in the UI using Matplotlib and the program has the ability to print the graphs and tables using excel as a medium
for formatting and the altering the look and then printing.
